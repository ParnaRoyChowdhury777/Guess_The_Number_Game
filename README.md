# Guess_The_Number_Game 🔢

Welcome to the "Guess The Number" game! Test your guessing skills and see if you can guess the correct number. 

This is a simple web-based game which allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range as chosen by the user himself (based on the difficulty level).

## 🎮 Game Rules  

- The computer selects a random number between 1 and 10 (easy level), 50 (intermediate level) and 100 (hard level).
- The player has 3 (easy) / 5 (intermediate) / 7 (hard) chances to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the player receives feedback on whether his guess is too high, too low or correct.
- If the player guesses the correct number within the given number of chances, he wins the game.
- If the player runs out of chances without guessing correctly, the game ends and the correct number is revealed.

## 🧷 Features 

- Interactive, responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Randomly generated number for each game.
- Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Keep track of the number of attempts.
- If the player wins, he receives a score out of 100 based on the number of attempts.
