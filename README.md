# Guess_The_Number_Game
Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game! This is a simple web-based game built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript which allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range as chosen by the user himself (based on difficulty level).

## Game Rules

- The computer selects a random number between 10 and 50.
- The player has 5 chances to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the player receives feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- If the player guesses the correct number within the given chances, they win the game.
- If the player runs out of chances without guessing correctly, the game ends, and the correct number is revealed.
